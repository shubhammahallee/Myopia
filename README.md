# 🔬 AI-Based Myopia Classification System

AI-based eye image classification system that predicts **Normal**, **Myopia**, and **High Myopia** using deep learning. The project includes model training, evaluation, and a Streamlit-based web application where doctors and patients can upload eye images and receive predictions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on medical image classification using deep learning techniques. Multiple models are trained and tested on eye image data to predict the severity of myopia. The best-performing model is deployed through an interactive Streamlit web interface for real-time prediction.

The workflow simulates a real-world clinical decision support system for preliminary vision assessment.
