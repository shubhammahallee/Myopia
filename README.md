# 🔬 AI-Based Myopia Classification System

An end-to-end deep learning project that classifies eye images into **Normal**, **Myopia**, and **High Myopia** categories using computer vision and neural networks. The system includes model training, evaluation, comparison, and a Streamlit-based web app for real-time prediction by doctors and patients.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on medical image classification using deep learning. Multiple models are trained and tested on eye image data to predict the severity level of myopia. The best-performing model is deployed through an interactive web interface where users can upload an eye image and receive instant predictions.

The workflow simulates a real-world clinical support tool for preliminary vision assessment.
